# Eliassen - Search Extensions

## Summary

The intention of this library is to provide a common means to define endpoints for the searching,
filtering, sorting and paging of data. As a mean to define a common interface and allow for faster
development it was determined to create a common design pattern for all data query screens.  

There was a preference to use existing off-the-shelf protocols and libraries as a means to provide
this data querying functionality.  Before designing this feature existing protocols were reviewed 
as such as OData and GraphQL.  Various limitations such as complexity in implementation and potential 
exposure personally identifiable information it was determined an in-house solution was required.  

## Design Goals and Use Cases

* Create a query model that allows for an easy to follow and reusable pattern
* Data selection patterns
  * The dataset in particular will be provided via an HTTP/RESTful endpoint
  * Part of the URI path may be used to select the named endpoint
  * Search term may be used to select rows from multiple columns within the database
  * Filter rules may be used to select rows based on a particular field within the dataset
    * equal, not equal, wild card (starts with, ends with, contains)
    * unbounded and bounded ranges
    * set value matching
* Multiple field sorting with the ability to select direction and priority order
* Data paging with the ability to change page size or disable paging to return all rows
* Make it easy to implement for developers

## Technical Requirements

* Define Query Request Model
* Define Paged Result Models
* Define Patterns for Filter
* Define Wild card expressions
* Define Patterns for Sort Order
* Define Patterns for Paging Request
* Extend ASP.Net Middleware to intercept and extends `IQueryable<>` returns from Controller/Actions
* Extend OpenAPI to present notes on available fields for request and response
* Create Expression Tree based framework to convert request models into LINQ queries
* HTTP Request type and formatting is detected from the related `Method` and `Content-Type`

## Architecture

### HTTP Data Query

```plantuml
title Query Process

User -> WebApi: Send Query Request
activate WebApi
  WebApi -> Middleware: Detect Action Return
  activate Middleware
    alt return is IQueryable
      Middleware -> Middleware : Store Request
      Middleware -> Action : Get Query Return
      activate Action
      return IQueryable
      Middleware -> QueryBuilder : Compose Query
      activate QueryBuilder
      return PagedResult      
    end
  return PagedResult
return PagedResult
```

## API Template

### Query

## Models

### Request

Note: the key values for `Filter` and `OrderBy` are based on fields from the `TModel` type

```plantuml
class SearchQuery<TModel> {
  + CurrentPage : integer
  + PageSize : integer
  + ExcludePageCount : boolean
  + SearchTerm : string
  + Filter : Dictionary<string, FilterParameter>
  + OrderBy : Dictionary<string, OrderDirections>
}

class FilterParameter {
  + EqualTo {eq} : object 
  + NotEqualTo {neq} : object
  + InSet {in} : object[]
  + GreaterThan {gt} : object
  + GreaterThanOrEqualTo {gte} : object
  + LessThan {lt} : object
  + LessThanOrEqualTo {lte} : object
}

enum OrderDirections {
  Ascending {asc}
  Descending {desc}
}

SearchQuery o-- FilterParameter
SearchQuery o-- OrderDirections
```

### Response

Note: `QueryResult` is the unpaged result while `PagedQueryResult` is only a single
page of possible results.  `QueryResult` with all matched records will be returns 
if the `PageSize` is equal to `-1` on the request.  Paging will still occur but total 
counts will not be calculated if `ExcludePageCount` is `true` on the request.

```plantuml
class QueryResult<TModel> {
  + Rows : TModel[]
}
class PagedQueryResult<TModel> {
  + CurrentPage : integer
  + TotalPageCount : integer
  + TotalRowCount : integer
}

PagedQueryResult <|-- QueryResult

```

## Technical Considerations

### Security

Authentication and authorization follow standard ASP.Net MVC configurations.

### Performance

To improve performance and processing queries will be composed by LINQ to the related
query provider allowing for data server processing including.  

## Examples

### Data Model

```plantuml
class User {
  + FirstName : string
  + LastName : string
  + EmailAddress : string
  + UserName : string
  + UserID : uuid
  + IsActive : bool
  + CreatedOn : DateTime

  + FirstLastName() => FirstName + " " + LastName
  + LastFirstName() => LastName + " " + FirstName
}
```

### Request - Starts with

Query first page where first name starts with `jim` and sort the results by `LastName " " FirstName`

```json
{
  "currentPage": 0,
  "filter": {
    "FirstName": {
      "eq": "jim*"
    }
  },
  "orderBy": {
    "lastFirstName" : "desc"
  }
}
```

### Request - Any field Contains

Query first page where any field contains `jim` with the default sort.

```json
{
  "currentPage": 0,
  "searchTerm": "*jim*"
}
```
