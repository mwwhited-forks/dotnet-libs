# Eliassen Libs - Build Extensions

## Summary

.Net provides a means to extend the build for your projects though the MSBuild Project SDK
You can directly make changes to the `.csproj` files for the project or you can add additional 
files such as `Directory.Build.props` and `Directory.Build.targets` to extend the build for 
the projects in your solution.  

By using these centralized files you can improve your build process to be more consistent and 
provide better feedback for your development team while they are developing their applications.
