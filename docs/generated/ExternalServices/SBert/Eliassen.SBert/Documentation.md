Here is the documentation for the provided source code files, including class diagrams in PlantUML:

**Eliassen.SBert.csproj**

* This is a .NET Core project file that defines the dependencies and configuration for the Eliassen.SBert project.

**ISentenceEmbeddingClient.cs**

* This interface defines the contract for a client that generates sentence embeddings using SBERT (Sentence-BERT).
* The interface has three methods:
	+ `GetEmbeddingAsync(string input)`: Generates an embedding for the given input sentence as an array of single-precision floating-point numbers.
	+ `GetEmbeddingDoubleAsync(string input)`: Generates an embedding for the given input sentence as an array of double-precision floating-point numbers.
	+ `GetHealthAsync()`: Checks the health status of the sentence embedding service.

**Readme.SBert.md**

* This is a Markdown file that contains a brief summary and notes about the Eliassen.SBert project.

**SbertHealthCheck.cs**

* This class implements a health check for the SBERT service.
* The class has a single method `CheckHealthAsync(HealthCheckContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)` that checks the health status of the service by calling the `GetHealthAsync()` method of the `ISentenceEmbeddingClient` interface.

**SentenceEmbeddingClient.cs**

* This class implements the `ISentenceEmbeddingClient` interface, which provides a client for interacting with the SBERT service.
* The class has three methods:
	+ `GetEmbeddingAsync(string input)`: Generates an embedding for the given input sentence as an array of single-precision floating-point numbers.
	+ `GetEmbeddingDoubleAsync(string input)`: Generates an embedding for the given input sentence as an array of double-precision floating-point numbers.
	+ `GetHealthAsync()`: Checks the health status of the sentence embedding service.

**SentenceEmbeddingOptions.cs**

* This class defines options for configuring the SBERT service.
* The class has a single property `Url` that specifies the URL of the SBERT service.

**SentenceEmbeddingProvider.cs**

* This class provides a provider for obtaining sentence embeddings using the SBERT service.
* The class has a single method `GetEmbeddingAsync(string content, string? model)` that gets an embedding for the given content using the `ISentenceEmbeddingClient` interface.

**SentenceEmbeddingProvider.puml**

```plantuml
!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Context.puml

!include C4_Context.puml

Person("System Administrator")

System "SBERT Service" {
  * ISentenceEmbeddingClient
  * SentenceEmbeddingClient
  * SbertHealthCheck
}

System "Application" {
  * SentenceEmbeddingProvider
}

System "Infrastructure" {
  * SentenceEmbeddingOptions
}

System "SBERT Service" -> "Application" : Request Sentence Embedding
System "Application" -> "SBERT Service" : Get Sentence Embedding
System "Application" -> "System Administrator" : Health Check
System "System Administrator" -> "SBERT Service" : Check Health

```

**ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs**

* This class provides extension methods for configuring services related to SBERT (Sentence-BERT).
* The class has a single method `TryAddSbertServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration, string sentenceEmbeddingOptionSection)` that configures the services for SBERT.

Here is the PlantUML diagram for the system:

```plantuml
!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Context.puml

!include C4_Context.puml

Person("System Administrator")

System "Bounded Context" {
  * SentenceEmbeddingClient
  * SbertHealthCheck
  * SentenceEmbeddingOptions
}

System "Domain" {
  * SentenceEmbeddingProvider
}

System "Infrastructure" {
  * HttpClient
}

System "Bounded Context" -> "Domain" : Request Sentence Embedding
System "Domain" -> "Infrastructure" : Get Sentence Embedding
System "System Administrator" -> "Bounded Context" : Health Check
System "Bounded Context" -> "System Administrator" : Check Health
```

I hope this documentation and diagram help! Let me know if you have any further questions.
