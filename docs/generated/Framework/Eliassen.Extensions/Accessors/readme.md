**Summary**

The Eliassen.Extensions.Accessors namespace provides a set of classes and interfaces that facilitate the creation and manipulation of accessors for values of various types. The main functionality of this library revolves around the `Accessor` class, which acts as a thread-safe wrapper for a value. This class is designed to provide a way to access and modify the value while ensuring that changes are thread-safe.

**Technical Summary**

The provided file, `Accessor.cs`, utilizes the `AsyncLocal` class from the .NET framework to implement a thread-safe accessor for values of generic type `T`. The `Accessor` class implements the `IAccessor<T>` interface and provides properties for getting and setting the value associated with the accessor. The use of `AsyncLocal` ensures that the value is thread-local, meaning that changes to the value are isolated to the current thread.

**Component Diagram**

```plantuml
@startuml
class Accessor<T> {
    - value: T?
    - local: AsyncLocal<T?>
}

class AsyncLocal<T> {
    - value: T?
}

Accessor<T> -- AsyncLocal<T>
IAccessor<T> -- Accessor<T>

This component diagram illustrates the relationships between the `Accessor` class, the `AsyncLocal` class, and the `IAccessor<T>` interface. The `Accessor` class is surrounded by an instance of `AsyncLocal` and implements the `IAccessor<T>` interface. The `AsyncLocal` class encapsulates the value being accessed and provides a thread-local storage mechanism. The `IAccessor<T>` interface defines the contract for accessing and modifying the value.
