As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll review the provided source code and suggest changes to make it more maintainable.

**Observations and Suggestions:**

1. **Naming Conventions**:
	* In `CommandLine.cs`, the namespace `Eliassen.Extensions.Configuration` has a mismatch in naming conventions (`Eliassen` vs. `Iliassen` in the file name). It's better to stick to a consistent naming convention throughout the project.
	* In `ConfigurationBuilderExtensions.cs`, the file name `ConfigurationBuilderExtensions` does not follow the standard `.Extensions` naming convention for extension methods. Consider renaming it to `IConfigurationBuilderExtensions`.
2. **Class Structure**:
	* `CommandLine.cs` contains two static classes, `CommandLine` and a nested class `AddParameters`. It would be more organized to separate these classes into distinct files. Consider moving `AddParameters` to a separate file named `AddParameters.cs` or `ParameterBuilder.cs`.
	* In `ConfigurationBuilderExtensions.cs`, the `AddInMemoryCollection` method has two overloads. While it's acceptable to use method overloading, it's more readable to use separate methods for each scenario. Consider breaking this into distinct methods like `AddInMemoryCollectionFromEnumerable` and `AddInMemoryCollectionFromItem`.
3. **Code Organization**:
	* In `CommandLine.cs`, the `BuildParameters` method is complex and performs multiple operations (Property filtering, lookup for attributes, and dictionary creation). Consider breaking this down into smaller, more focused methods to improve maintainability.
	* In `ConfigurationBuilderExtensions.cs`, the `AddInMemoryCollection` method creates a dictionary from a grouped enumerable. You could consider using `ToDictionary` with a lambda expression instead of creating an anonymous object and grouping.
4. **Comments and Documentation**:
	* The code has some comments, but they could be more detailed and descriptive. It's essential to provide sufficient comments to explain the purpose and logic of each method or section of code.
	* Consider using XML documentation comments (`/// <summary>`) to provide detailed descriptions and explanations for each method or class.
5. **Code Consistency**:
	* In `CommandLine.cs`, the `AddParameters` method has inconsistent naming conventions for method parameters (`items` vs. `initialData`). Try to maintain consistent naming conventions throughout the code.
	* In `ConfigurationBuilderExtensions.cs`, the `AddInMemoryCollection` method uses inconsistent naming conventions for method parameters (`initialData` vs. `item`).
6. **Type Usages**:
	* In `CommandLine.cs`, the `TypeDescriptor.GetProperties` method is used to get properties of a type. Consider using the more specific `typeof(T).GetProperties()` instead, which has the same purpose but is more concise.
	* In `ConfigurationBuilderExtensions.cs`, the `IEnumerable<(string key, string? value)>` type is used as a parameter. Consider using a more descriptive type name, such as `IConfigurationItemCollection`, to improve readability.

**Proposed Code Changes:**

1. Move `AddParameters` to a separate file named `ParameterBuilder.cs`.
2. Break down complex methods into smaller, more focused methods.
3. Use consistent naming conventions throughout the code.
4. Add more detailed comments and XML documentation comments.
5. Improve code organization by separating concerns and using meaningful method names.

Here's an example of how the proposed changes could look:
```csharp
// ParameterBuilder.cs
public static class ParameterBuilder
{
    public static IDictionary<string, string> AddParameters<T>(this IDictionary<string, string> items) =>
        items.Concat(BuildParameters<T>()).GroupBy(i => i.Key, Comparer).ToDictionary(i => i.Key, i => i.First().Value, Comparer);

    private static IEnumerable<(string Key, string Value)> BuildParameters<T>()
    {
        var type = typeof(T);
        var properties = type.GetProperties().Where(p => p.PropertyType == typeof(string)).Select(p =>
        {
            var attribute = p.GetCustomAttributes<CommandParameterAttribute>().FirstOrDefault();
            var key = $"--{attribute?.Short ?? p.Name}";
            var value = $"{type.Name}:{p.Name}";
            return (key, value);
        });
        return properties;
    }
}

// IConfigurationBuilderExtensions.cs
public static class IConfigurationBuilderExtensions
{
    public static IConfigurationBuilder AddInMemoryCollectionFromEnumerable(this IConfigurationBuilder configurationBuilder, IEnumerable<(string key, string? value)> initialData)
    {
        return configurationBuilder.AddInMemoryCollection(initialData.ToDictionary(i => i.Key, i => i.Value));
    }

    public static IConfigurationBuilder AddInMemoryCollectionFromItem(this IConfigurationBuilder configurationBuilder, (string key, string? value) item, params (string key, string? value)[] initialData)
    {
        return configurationBuilder.AddInMemoryCollection(new[] { item }.Concat(initialData));
    }
}
```
These changes will improve the maintainability and readability of the code
