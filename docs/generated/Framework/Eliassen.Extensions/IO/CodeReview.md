As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll provide a comprehensive review of the code and suggest changes to make it more maintainable.

**Overview**

The code consists of three static classes: `FileTools`, `StreamExtensions`, and `StreamJsonDeserializeExtensions` and `StreamXmlDeserializeExtensions`. It provides methods for working with files and streams, specifically splitting files into chunks, copying streams, and deserializing JSON and XML streams.

**Code Review**

1. **Naming Conventions**: The class and method names follow a consistent naming convention. However, some method names could be more descriptive, such as `SplitReadStreamAsync` instead of `SplitStreamAsync`.
2. **Namespace**: The namespace `Eliassen.Extensions.IO` is used consistently throughout the code. It's a good practice to define a separate namespace for each assembly or module.
3. **Class Design**: The static classes are designed well, with each class having a clear responsibility (e.g., `StreamExtensions` for extensions). However, the classes could benefit from descriptive comments and brief summaries of their purpose.
4. **Method Implementation**: The methods are generally well-implemented, but some could be refactored for improved performance and maintainability.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

**FileTools.cs**

1. **Inconsistent Parameter Naming**: The `SplitFileAsync` method uses both camelCase and PascalCase for parameter names. Consistency is key to maintainability.
2. **Error Handling**: The method does not handle errors well; it could benefit from proper exception handling.

**StreamExtensions.cs**

1. **Method Name**: Rename `CopyOf` to something more descriptive, such as `CreateMemoryStreamCopy`.
2. **Constants**: The default values for `DefaultChunkLength` and `DefaultOverlap` could be extracted into a separate class or module.
3. **Method Implementation**: The `SplitStreamAsync` method could be refactored to use a `while` loop instead of recursion for better performance.

**StreamJsonDeserializeExtensions.cs**

1. **Method Name**: Rename `AsJsonAsync` to something more descriptive, such as `DeserializeJsonAsync`.
2. **Type Parameters**: The methods could benefit from type parameters to allow for more flexibility.

**StreamXmlDeserializeExtensions.cs**

1. **Method Name**: Rename `AsXmlAsync` to something more descriptive, such as `DeserializeXmlAsync`.
2. **XmlSerializer**: The `XmlSerializer` class does not handle complex types well. Consider using a more robust serialization library.

**Code Structure**

1. **Consider Moving Extension Methods**: The `StreamExtensions` class contains several extension methods. Consider moving these methods to a separate interface or abstract class to improve isolation and testing.
2. **Consistent Code Organization**: The code could benefit from a consistent organization, such as grouping related methods together or using sub-nested classes.

**Conclusion**

Overall, the code is well-organized, and the classes follow a consistent naming convention. However, there are opportunities for improvement, such as refactoring method names, implementing proper error handling, and enhancing code organization.
