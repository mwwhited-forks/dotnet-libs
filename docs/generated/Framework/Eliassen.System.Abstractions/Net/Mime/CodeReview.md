As a senior software engineer and solutions architect, I'll provide a review of the provided code and suggest changes to improve its maintainability.

**Code Review**

The given code is a static class with two nested classes, `Text` and `Application`, which define constants representing various content types. The code is well-organized, and the comments provide a good summary of each constant.

**Suggested Changes**

1. **Naming Conventions**:
The constant names are not following the PascalCase naming convention. In C#, it's more conventional to use PascalCase for constants. For example, `HandlebarsTemplate` could be renamed to `HandlebarsTemplateContentType`.
2. **Class Structure**:
Consider reorganizing the code to use a single class with public static properties instead of separate nested classes. This would reduce the complexity and make the code easier to maintain.
3. **Constants vs. Enums**:
The code uses constants, but since these are used to represent distinct values, consider using an enum instead. Enums are more self-documenting and provide additional benefits like compile-time checking and better code readability.
4. **Namespace Organization**:
The code is placed in the `Eliassen.System.Net.Mime` namespace, which might not be the most suitable location. Consider moving this class to a more specific namespace like `Eliassen.ContentTypes` or `Eliassen.MimeTypes`.
5. **Documentation**:
The code comments are concise and provide a good summary of each constant. However, consider adding XML documentation comments to provide more detailed information and make it easier for other developers to understand the code.
6. **Code Organization**:
The code consists of a single file with two nested classes. Consider breaking this down into separate files, one for each class, or using a code generator to generate these classes.

**Improved Code Structure**

Here's an example of how you could reorganize the code using a single class with public static properties and enums:
```
namespace Eliassen.MimeTypes
{
    public static class MimeTypes
    {
        public enum Text.ContentType
        {
            HandlebarsTemplate = "text/x-handlebars-template",
            Calendar = "text/calendar",
            Html = "text/html",
            Markdown = "text/markdown",
            Yaml = "text/yaml",
            Plain = "text/plain"
        }

        public enum Application.ContentType
        {
            Xslt = "application/xslt+xml"
        }

        public static string GetMimeType(Text.ContentType type)
        {
            return type.ToString();
        }

        public static string GetMimeType<Application.ContentType>(type)
        {
            return type.ToString();
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses enums to define the content types, makes the code more readable, and provides a simple way to retrieve the content type strings. You can also add additional logic in the `GetMimeType` methods to handle specific cases or provide more robust error handling.
