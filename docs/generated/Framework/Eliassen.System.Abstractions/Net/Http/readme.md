**Summary**

This library provides a set of classes and constants for representing and working with HTTP headers and correlation information. The `CorrelationInfo` class provides properties for storing correlation and request identifiers, while the `DefinedHttpHeaders` class contains constant values for commonly used HTTP headers.

**Technical Summary**

The `CorrelationInfo` class uses a simple data structure to represent correlation and request information, with properties for storing correlation identifiers and request identifiers. The `DefinedHttpHeaders` class uses a set of constants to represent commonly used HTTP headers, such as "X-Correlation-ID" and "X-Request-ID". This approach allows for easy access and manipulation of these headers in HTTP requests and responses.

**Design Patterns**

The architecture of this library follows a simple and straightforward design pattern, with no complex design patterns implemented.

**Component Diagram**

Here is a component diagram showing the relationships between the classes:
```plantuml
@startuml
namespace Eliassen.System.Net.Http

class CorrelationInfo {
  - CorrelationId: string?
  - RequestId: string?
}

class DefinedHttpHeaders {
  - CorrelationIdHeader: string
  - RequestIdHeader: string
  - AcceptLanguage: string
  - ContentLanguage: string
}

CorrelationInfo --* DefinedHttpHeaders
