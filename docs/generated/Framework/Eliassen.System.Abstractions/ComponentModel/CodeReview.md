reetings,

I'm happy to review your code and provide suggestions for improvements.

**Overall Assessment**

Your code is clean and well-organized. You've used attributes effectively to add metadata to your classes and enums. Here are some specific feedback points:

**Minor Suggestions**

1. **Consistent naming conventions**: You're using both camelCase and PascalCase naming conventions. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the codebase. In C#, it's common to use PascalCase for class names and PascalCase or camelCase for variable names.

2. **Type parameters**: In the `EnumValueAttribute`, you're not using the `TEnum` type parameter from `AttributeUsage`. It's better to specify the enum type explicitly for better code readability.

3. **Initialize values**: In the `EnumValueAttribute`, you're allowing the `Name` property to be initialized with an initializer expression (`init`). This is a nice C# 9.0 feature, but it's not used in this specific case. You could remove the initializer expression, as the property is already initialized with a default value.

4. **Interface name**: The `IVersionProvider` interface could have a more descriptive name, like `IAssemblyVersionInfo`.

**Improved Code Structure and Class Design**

1. **Common attribute namespace**: You could move the attributes to a separate namespace, like `Eliassen.Attributes`, to group them together. This would make it easier to find and reuse them.

2. **Version information separation**: The `IVersionProvider` interface could be extracted to a separate assembly or module to encapsulate the version information. This would allow you to version the version information independently of the other code.

3. **Component structure**: The `Eliassen.System.ComponentModel` namespace could be further organized into sub-namespaces, for example, `Eliassen.System.ComponentModel.Attributes` for the attributes and `Eliassen.System.ComponentModel.Extensions` for any extensions or helpers.

**Alternative Coding Patterns**

1. **Using a builder pattern**: Instead of having separate classes for end state, enum value, and exclude from uniqueness attributes, you could use a single builder class that allows you to create and configure these attributes.

Example:
```csharp
public class AttributeBuilder
{
    public static EndStateAttribute EndState(string name) => new EndStateAttribute { Name = name };
    public static EnumValueAttribute EnumValue(string name) => new EnumValueAttribute(name);
    public static ExcludeFromUniqueAttribute ExcludeFromUnique() => new ExcludeFromUniqueAttribute();
}
```
This would simplify the code and make it easier to create and use these attributes.

There are no critical errors or bugs in your code. The refactoring suggestions above are aimed at making the code more maintainable, readable, and scalable.
