**Summary**

The Eliassen.System.Text.Xml.Serialization namespace contains a set of files related to XML serialization. The main entry point is the IXmlSerializer interface, which defines a contract for sharing a common XML serialization process. This interface inherits from ISerializer, which is not shown in this README.

**Technical Summary**

The IXmlSerializer interface is an example of a Design Pattern, specifically the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP). This pattern aims to decouple clients from implementations by providing multiple, high-level interfaces that are client-specific rather than a single, general-purpose interface. In this case, the ISP is applied to the XML serialization process, allowing clients to interact with a shared serialization service without knowing the implementation details.

The interface itself does not contain any meaningful implementation, as it is intended to be implemented by a concrete class or an abstract class with concrete implementations. This approach follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), where each class or component has a single, well-defined responsibility.

**Component Diagram**

```plantuml
@startuml
class IXmlSerializer {
  +ISerializer
}

class ISerializer {
  - serialize
}

class ConcreteXmlSerializer implements IXmlSerializer {
  +ISerializer
  - serialize
}

XmlSerializerClient -->> IXmlSerializer
ISerializer -->> XmlSerializer

```

In this diagram, `IXmlSerializer` is the interface that defines the shared XML serialization process. `ISerializer` is an abstract interface that contains the `serialize` method, which is implemented by `ConcreteXmlSerializer`. The `XmlSerializerClient` interacts with `IXmlSerializer` to serialize XML data.

Note: The actual implementation of `ConcreteXmlSerializer` and `XmlSerializerClient` is not shown in this README.
