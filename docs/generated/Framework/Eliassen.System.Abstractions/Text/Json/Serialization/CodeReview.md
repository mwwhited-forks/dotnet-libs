Overall, the code looks clean and maintainable. However, there are a few suggestions I have to improve the coding patterns, methods, structure, and classes to make the code even more maintainable:

**IJsonSerializer.cs**

* Consider adding a default implementation for the `AsPropertyName` method. This can help reduce the number of places where you need to implement this method.
* Consider making the `AsPropertyName` method virtual, so that it can be overridden in derived classes.

**JsonStringEnumConverterEx.cs**

* The `Read` method contains a `default` return statement, which can cause issues if the method is not able to read a valid enum value. Consider throwing a `JsonException` instead, to provide a more informative error message.
* The `Write` method uses the `EnumExtensions.AsString<TEnum>(value)` extension method. Consider making this method an instance method on the `JsonStringEnumConverterEx<TEnum>` class, so that it can be reused.
* Consider adding a `ToString` method to the `JsonStringEnumConverterEx<TEnum>` class, which returns the serialized enum value as a string. This can be useful for logging and debugging purposes.

**IBsonSerializer.cs**

* This interface is unused. If you're not planning to implement BSON serialization, consider removing this interface.

**Suggestions**

* Consider moving the `JsonStringEnumConverterEx` class to a separate namespace or assembly, to keep the Eliassen.System.Text.Json.Serialization namespace focused on serialization-related interfaces and classes.
* Consider adding a custom attribute to the `JsonStringEnumConverterEx` class, to indicate that it's a custom converter for enums. This can help with discoverability and make it easier to find custom converters.

**Refactoring Suggestions**

* Create a `BaseJsonConverter` class that inherits from `JsonConverter<T>` and provides a basic implementation for reading and writing JSON. This can help reduce code duplication and make it easier to add custom conversion logic.
* Create a `EnumConverter` class that inherits from `BaseJsonConverter<T>` and provides specific conversion logic for enums. This can help keep the custom logic separate from the basic conversion logic.

Here's an updated version of the code, incorporating some of these suggestions:
```
namespace Eliassen.System.Text.Json.Serialization.Converters
{
    public abstract class BaseJsonConverter<T> : JsonConverter<T> where T : Enum
    {
        public abstract T Read(ref Utf8JsonReader reader, Type typeToConvert, JsonSerializerOptions options);
        public abstract void Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, T value, JsonSerializerOptions options);
    }

    public class EnumConverter<TEnum> : BaseJsonConverter<TEnum> where TEnum : struct, Enum
    {
        public override TEnum Read(ref Utf8JsonReader reader, Type typeToConvert, JsonSerializerOptions options)
        {
            // Implement reading logic for enums
        }

        public override void Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, TEnum value, JsonSerializerOptions options)
        {
            writer.WriteStringValue(EnumExtensions.AsString<TEnum>(value));
        }
    }
}
```
Note that this is just a suggestion, and the best approach will depend on your specific requirements and constraints.
