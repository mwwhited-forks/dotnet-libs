As a senior software engineer and solutions architect, I'll review the provided code and suggest changes to improve its maintainability. Here's my analysis and recommendations:

**ITemplateProvider.cs**

1. **Interface naming convention**: The interface name `ITemplateProvider` is not following the standard .NET interface naming convention, which is to use the `I` prefix only for interfaces that implement a specific standard (e.g., `IEnumerable<T>`). Consider renaming the interface to `TemplateProvider` or something more descriptive.
2. **Property naming convention**: The `SupportedContentTypes` property name is not following the standard .NET property naming convention, which is to use PascalCase. Consider renaming it to `SupportedContentTypeNames` or something more descriptive.
3. **Method naming convention**: The `ApplyAsync` method name is not following the standard .NET method naming convention, which is to use PascalCase. Consider renaming it to `ApplyTemplateAsync` or something more descriptive.
4. **Async programming**: The `ApplyAsync` method is marked as `async`, but it doesn't follow the recommended async programming patterns. Consider using the `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` and `IAsyncDisposable` interfaces to make the method more efficient and easier to use.

**ITemplateSource.cs**

1. **Interface naming convention**: The interface name `ITemplateSource` is following the standard .NET interface naming convention. Good job!
2. **Method naming convention**: The `Get` method name is not following the standard .NET method naming convention, which is to use PascalCase. Consider renaming it to `GetTemplateContexts` or something more descriptive.

**Suggested changes**

1. Rename `ITemplateProvider` to `TemplateEngine` or something more descriptive.
2. Rename `SupportedContentTypes` to `SupportedContentTypesCollection` or something more descriptive.
3. Rename `ApplyAsync` to `ApplyTemplateAsync` or something more descriptive.
4. Use `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` and `IAsyncDisposable` interfaces to improve async programming efficiency.
5. Rename `ITemplateSource` to `TemplateRepository` or something more descriptive.
6. Rename `Get` to `GetTemplateContexts` or something more descriptive.

Here's an updated version of the code with the suggested changes:
```csharp
// ITemplateEngine.cs
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.IAsyncEnumerable;
using System.IAsyncDisposable;

namespace Eliassen.System.Text.Templating;

public interface TemplateEngine
{
    IReadOnlyCollection<string> SupportedContentTypeNames { get; }

    bool CanApply(ITemplateContext context);

    IAsyncEnumerable<bool> ApplyTemplateAsync(ITemplateContext context, object data, Stream target);
}

// ITemplateRepository.cs
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Eliassen.System.Text.Templating;

public interface TemplateRepository
{
    IAsyncEnumerable<ITemplateContext> GetTemplateContexts(string templateName);
}
```
Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and maintainable, but with a few minor adjustments, it can be even more efficient and easier to use.
