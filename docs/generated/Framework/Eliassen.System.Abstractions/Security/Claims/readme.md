**Summary**
This package contains a set of extensions and constants for working with Claims Principals in .NET. The `ClaimsPrincipalExtensions` class provides methods for iterating and searching Through Claims Principals, while the `CommonClaims` class defines a set of constants for common claims used in authentication.

**Technical Summary**
The `ClaimsPrincipalExtensions` class uses the Observer pattern to iterate and search through claims principals. The `GetAllClaims` method uses LINQ to select and flatten the list of claims from each identity in the claims principal. The `GetClaimValues` method uses LINQ to join the list of claims to an input array of claim types and filter out claims with null or empty values. The `GetClaimValue` method uses the `FirstOrDefault` method to return the first matched claim value.

The `CommonClaims` class is an example of a Singleton pattern, where the constants are defined as public static properties.
