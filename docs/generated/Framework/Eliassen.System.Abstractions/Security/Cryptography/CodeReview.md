A simple interface for a hash generator! As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll provide some suggestions to improve the code's maintainability, readability, and usability.

**Naming Conventions**

* Minor suggestion: Consider using PascalCase (e.g., `IHashGenerator` instead of `IHash`) for interface names, following .NET naming conventions.
* Minor suggestion: Use descriptive suffixes for the `GetHash` method, such as `GetHashValue` or `ComputeHash`, to make its purpose clearer.

**Interface Structure**

* Suggestion: Consider adding some overloads for the `GetHash` method, allowing users to pass different types of input values (e.g., `byte[]`, `Guid`, `DateTime`, etc.) and retrieve corresponding hash values.
* Suggestion: Think about adding some additional methods to the interface, such as `GetHashAlgorithm()` to return the underlying hashing algorithm used or `IsHashValid()` to check if a hash is valid.

**Method Implementation**

* Minor suggestion: Consider using the `using` statement for the `HashGet` method to ensure the Dispose() method is called when the `IHash` object is no longer needed.

**Additional Suggestions**

* Add comments to the interface and methods explaining the purpose and expected behavior.
* Consider creating a base class or abstract class implementing the `IHash` interface, allowing for easier extension and reuse.
* For larger applications, consider adding a separate unit tests project to test the `IHash` interface and its implementations.

**Updated Code**

```csharp
namespace Eliassen.System.Security.Cryptography;

/// <summary>
/// Simplified hash generator
/// </summary>
public interface IHashGenerator
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Computes the hash value for the input value
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="value">Value to hash</param>
    /// <returns>Hash value</returns>
    string GetHashValue(string value);

    /// <summary>
    /// Computes the hash value for the input bytes
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="value">Value to hash (bytes)</param>
    /// <returns>Hash value</returns>
    string GetHashValue(byte[] value);

    // Other overloads or methods as needed...

    /// <summary>
    /// Returns the hash algorithm used
    /// </summary>
    /// <returns>Hash algorithm name</returns>
    string GetHashAlgorithm();

    /// <summary>
    /// Checks if the hash value is valid
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="hashCode">Hash value to validate</param>
    /// <returns>True if the hash value is valid, false otherwise</returns>
    bool IsValidHash(string hashCode);
}
```

Apply these suggestions to your source code, and you'll have a more maintainable, scalable, and reliable interface for hashing values.
