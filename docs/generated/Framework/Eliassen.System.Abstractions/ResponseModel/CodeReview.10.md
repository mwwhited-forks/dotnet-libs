As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll review the provided source code and suggest improvements to make it more maintainable.

**Code Review**

The `ResultMessage` class defines a simple data transfer object (DTO) to represent a response message with various properties. The code is straightforward, and the properties are properly documented with summaries.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Enums instead of built-in types for MessageLevels**: Instead of using the built-in `MessageLevels` type, consider defining an enum for the message levels. This will help ensure that only valid values are assigned to the `Level` property and improve code readability.
```csharp
public enum MessageLevels
{
    Information,
    Warning,
    Error,
    // Add more levels as necessary
}
```
2. **Remove `required` keyword**: Since the `Message` property is a string, it's not necessary to use the `required` keyword. The compiler will ensure that a value is provided for this property.
```csharp
public string Message { get; init; }
```
3. **Consider adding validation**: With the `init` accessor, you can perform validation on the properties when the object is initialized. For example, you can ensure that the `Message` property is not empty or null.
```csharp
public string Message { get; init; } = string.IsNullOrEmpty(Message) ? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(Message)) : Message;
```
4. **Consider adding additional validation for MessageCode and Context**: Since `MessageCode` and `Context` are optional, consider adding validation to ensure that they meet specific criteria (e.g., length, format).
5. **MetaData property can be reconsidered**: The `MetaData` property is optional and can be of any type. Consider re-evaluating the need for this property or providing a clearer definition of what types of data it should hold.
```csharp
public object? MetaData { get; init; } // Consider removing or redefining this property
```
6. **Consider creating a base class or interface for responses**: If you plan to create other response classes with similar properties, consider creating a base class or interface to ensure consistency and ease of extension.

**Refactored Code**
```csharp
namespace Eliassen.System.ResponseModel;

public enum MessageLevels
{
    Information,
    Warning,
    Error,
    // Add more levels as necessary
}

public record ResultMessage
{
    public MessageLevels Level { get; init; } = MessageLevels.Information;

    public string Message { get; init; }

    public string? MessageCode { get; init; }

    public string? Context { get; init; }

    // Consider removing or redefining the MetaData property
    // public object? MetaData { get; init; }
}
```
By addressing these suggestions, the code becomes more maintainable by:

* Improving code readability with enums and clear property names
* Reducing errors through validation
* Simplifying the code structure by removing unnecessary keywords and properties
* Preparing the code for potential future enhancements by considering a base class or interface for responses
