**README File**

The Eliassen.System.Linq.Search namespace provides a set of interfaces and classes for building and executing search queries. The main components are:

1. `FilterParameter`: A class that represents a filter parameter for a search query, allowing for filtering by equality, inequality, range, and set membership.
2. `IFilterQuery`: An interface that provides a collection of filter parameters for a search query.
3. `IPageQuery`: An interface that provides pagination options for a search query, including current page number, page size, and exclusion of total page count.
4. `IQueryBuilder`: An interface that provides methods for executing queries with search parameters, including typed and non-typed queries.
5. `ISearchQuery`: An interface that combines page, sort, search term, and filter criteria for searching data.

**Technical Summary**

The design patterns used in this namespace are:

1. The `FilterParameter` class uses the Builder design pattern to construct filter parameters.
2. The `IQueryBuilder` interface uses the Facade design pattern to simplify the execution of queries.
3. The `ISearchQuery` interface uses the Composite design pattern to combine page, sort, search term, and filter criteria.

The architectural patterns used are:

1. The Repository pattern is used to decouple the query builder from the data source.
2. The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is used to separate the concerns of different query types (e.g., typed and non-typed).
