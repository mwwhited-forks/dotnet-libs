As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll review the provided source code and suggest changes to improve the coding patterns, methods, structure, and classes to make it more maintainable.

**Project Structure**

The provided project structure seems to be fine, with separate projects for different components and a clear naming convention.

**Class Structure**

The `MessageSenderTests` class has a mix of test methods and utility methods. It's a good practice to separate concerns by moving the utility methods to a separate class or module.

**Formatting and Naming**

The code follows a consistent naming convention, but some methods could benefit from more descriptive names. For example, `GetServiceProvider` could be renamed to `CreateServiceProvider`.

**Code Duplication**

The `SendAsync` test methods have duplicated code for creating the configuration builder and service provider. This code duplication could be avoided by creating a separate method for this logic.

**Service Provider**

The `GetServiceProvider` method creates a service provider instance with a lot of dependencies. This method could be refactored to use dependency injection registration instead of manual registration.

**Testing**

The tests seem to be well-written, but some method names could be more descriptive. For example, `SendAsyncTest_ByFullType` could be renamed to `SendAsyncTest_EmptyMessage`.

**Suggestions**

Here are some specific suggestions for improvement:

1. Extract a separate class for the utility methods in `MessageSenderTests`.
2. Rename the `GetServiceProvider` method to `CreateServiceProvider` and refactor it to use dependency injection registration.
3. Move the duplicated code for creating the configuration builder and service provider to a separate method.
4. Improve the method naming in the tests to make them more descriptive.
5. Consider using a more robust logging mechanism instead of `TestContext.Write`.
6. Check for circular dependencies in the project structure and refactor accordingly.
7. Consider applying a consistent convention for naming the properties and variables.
8. Review the usage of `required` properties to ensure they are used correctly.
9. Review the usage of `public static IServiceProvider GetServiceProvider` to ensure it's not used as a singleton.
10. Consider using a more efficient data structure instead of a dictionary for storing configuration settings.

**Refactored Code**

Here's an example of how the code could be refactored to address some of the suggestions:
```csharp
namespace Eliassen.MessageQueueing.Tests
{
    public class MessageSenderTestsUtilities
    {
        public static IConfiguration BuildConfiguration(string providerName)
        {
            var configBuilder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
            configBuilder.AddInMemoryCollection(new Dictionary<string, string>
            {
                {"MessageQueue:MessageSenderTests:Provider", providerName },
            });
            return configBuilder.Build();
        }
    }

    public class MessageSenderTests
    {
        public required TestContext TestContext { get; set; }

        [TestMethod]
        [TestCategory(TestCategories.Simulate)]
        public async Task SendAsyncTest_EmptyMessage()
        {
            var config = MessageSenderTestsUtilities.BuildConfiguration(TestMessageSenderProvider.ProviderName);
            var service = CreateServiceProvider(TestContext, config);

            // ...
        }

        // ...
    }
}
```
Note that this is just an example, and the actual refactoring will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
