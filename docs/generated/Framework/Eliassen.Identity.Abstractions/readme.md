**Summary**

The Eliassen.Identity.Abstractions project provides a set of abstractions and models for facilitating user identity management. It defines two main interfaces: `IIdentityManager` and `IUserManagementProvider`. `IIdentityManager` represents an identity manager responsible for managing user identities, while `IUserManagementProvider` provides methods for managing user accounts. The project includes several models, such as `UserIdentityModel`, `UserCreateModel`, and `UserCreatedModel`, which are used to represent user identity information, create user accounts, and store created user data.

**Technical Summary**

The project uses the following design patterns:

1. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Separates the `IIdentityManager` interface into two different interfaces, `IIdentityManager` and `IUserManagementProvider`, each with its own set of methods. This allows for more flexibility and maintainability.
2. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each interface has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand and modify.

The project also uses the following architectural patterns:

1. **Layered Architecture**: The project is structured in a layered architecture, with the core logic in `IIdentityManager` and `IUserManagementProvider`, and the data models in separate classes.

This diagram shows the components of the Eliassen.Identity.Abstractions project, including the `IIdentityManager` and `IUserManagementProvider` interfaces, as well as the data models such as `UserIdentityModel`, `UserCreateModel`, and `UserCreatedModel`. It also shows the relationships between these components, including the dependencies and boundaries.
