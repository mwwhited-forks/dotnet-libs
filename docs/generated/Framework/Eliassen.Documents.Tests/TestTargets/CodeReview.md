As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll review the source code and suggest changes to improve maintainability.

**Overall Impression**

The provided code consists of two separate classes, `ContainerTargetClass` and `ContainerTargetClassWithTag`, both residing in the `Eliassen.Documents.Tests.TestTargets` namespace. The classes appear to be simple, with no implementation logic. The use of attributes (`[BlobContainer]`) suggests that these classes might be used for some kind of configuration or metadata.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Entity-Persistable relationships**: Based on the attribute `[BlobContainer]`, it seems that these classes are related to a persistence layer (e.g., a database or a file system). To improve maintainability, consider creating a separate interface or base class that defines the common properties and methods for both classes. This would allow for more flexibility and reusability.
2. **Naming Conventions**: The class names `ContainerTargetClass` and `ContainerTargetClassWithTag` are similar, but not identical. Consider using a consistent naming convention, such as using the suffix "Tagged" only for the second class. This would make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. **Attribute placement**: The attribute `[BlobContainer]` is used to decorate the class `ContainerTargetClassWithTag`. Consider moving this attribute to a separate interface or base class, making it more reusable and applicable to future classes.
4. **NSwag/OpenApi**: If these classes are being used to generate swagger/OpenAPI documentation, consider using a dedicated library like NSwag or OpenApiAttribute to simplify the process.
5. **Empty classes**: Both classes are currently empty and do not contain any implementation logic. Consider removing them if they are no longer needed or refactoring them to hold meaningful data or behavior.
6. **Code organization**: The code is organized in a single namespace (`Eliassen.Documents.Tests.TestTargets`). Consider separating the code into multiple namespaces or folders to reflect the logical structure of the project.

**Proposed Refactored Code**

Here's a possible refactored version of the code, incorporating some of the suggestions above:

```csharp
// ContainerTarget.cs (interface or base class)
namespace Eliassen.Documents.Tests.TestTargets;

public interface IContainerTarget
{
    string ContainerName { get; set; }
}

// ContainerTargetWithTag.cs
namespace Eliassen.Documents.Tests.TestTargets;

[BlobContainer]
public class ContainerTargetWithTag : IContainerTarget
{
    public string ContainerName { get; set; }
    public string Tag { get; set; }
}

// ContainerTargetTaggedAttribute.cs (attribute to decorate classes)
namespace Eliassen.Documents.Tests.TestTargets;

[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class)]
public class BlobContainerAttribute : Attribute
{
    public string ContainerName { get; set; }
}
```

By following these suggestions, the code becomes more maintainable, reusable, and easier to understand.
