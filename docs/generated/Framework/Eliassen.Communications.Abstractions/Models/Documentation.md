## Component Model

The Eliassen Communications system consists of several components, including:

* **Email Processing**: responsible for processing inbound and outbound email messages
* **SMS Processing**: responsible for processing inbound and outbound SMS messages
* **Attachment Management**: responsible for managing attachments associated with email and SMS messages
* **Message Storage**: responsible for storing and retrieving email and SMS messages

These components interact with each other to provide a comprehensive communication solution.
