### Components

The following components are part of the Eliassen.Communications.Abstractions library:

#### `ICommunicationSender<TMessage>`

The `ICommunicationSender<TMessage>` interface is provided as a means to interact with various channel providers. Example channels are hosted for `EmailMessageModel` and `SmsMessageModel`.

@startuml
class ICommunicationSender<TMessage> {
  - sendAsync(TMessage message): Task<string>
}

}

class SmsMessageModel {
  // Attributes and methods
}

//Include ICommunicationSender<EmailMessageModel> in your service class

public class ExampleClass (
    ICommunicationSender<EmailMessageModel> email
    )
{
    public async Task<string> SendAsync(EmailMessageModel message) =>
        await email.SendAsync(message);
}
```
### How to Use

To use the Eliassen.Communications.Abstractions library, you need to reference the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions` NuGet package and include the `ICommunicationSender<TMessage>` interface in your service class.

**Sequence Diagram**
```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber

participant "ExampleClass" as example
participant "ICommunicationSender<EmailMessageModel>" as sender

example -> sender: SendAsync(emailMessageModel)
sender ->> smtpServer: SendAsync(emailMessageModel)
smtpServer ->> example: SendCompleted(emailMessageModel)
