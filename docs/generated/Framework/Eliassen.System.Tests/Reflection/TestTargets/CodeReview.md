As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I will review the provided source code and suggest changes to improve its maintainability.

**Observations and Suggestions**

1. **Namespace**: The namespace `Eliassen.System.Tests.Reflection.TestTargets` seems redundant and could be simplified. It's common to have a top-level namespace for a project and then use subnamespaces for organized groupings of related classes. Consider simplifying the namespace to `Eliassen.Tests` or `Eliassen.Testing`, for example.

2. **Class**: The class `TestModel` is a good candidate for a Data Transfer Object (DTO) or a simple Model. It's not doing anything complex, and its purpose is mostly to hold data. 

3. **Property**: The `Property` field is marked as `required`, which is a good practice to indicate that it cannot be null or empty.

4. **Getters and Setters**: The class has getters and setters for the `Property` field. In this case, it doesn't add much value, but if `TestModel` were a complex class with multiple properties, getters and setters might be useful to encapsulate logic.

5. **Code Organization**: The code structure seems fine, but if this class is part of a larger system, it might be useful to consider splitting it into smaller classes for better organization and reuse.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

**1. Simplify the namespace**
```csharp
namespace Eliassen.Tests
{
    public class TestModel
    {
        public required string Property { get; set; }
    }
}
```

**2. Add comments and documentation**
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// A simple test model for demonstration purposes.
/// </summary>
namespace Eliassen.Tests
{
    public class TestModel
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// The property value must be a non-empty string.
        /// </summary>
        public required string Property { get; set; }
    }
}
```

**3. Consider extracting the property logic into a separate class**
```csharp
namespace Eliassen.Tests
{
    public class StringProperty : Property<string>
    {
        public string Property { get; set; }
    }
}
```

**4. Implement a base class for the test models**
```csharp
namespace Eliassen.Tests
{
    public abstract class TestModelBase
    {
        public string Property { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Remember that the changes I've suggested are subjective and may not be necessary for your specific project.
