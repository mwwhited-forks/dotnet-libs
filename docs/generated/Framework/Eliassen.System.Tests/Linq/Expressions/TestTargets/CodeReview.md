As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I appreciate the simple and straightforward design of the provided source code. However, I do have a few suggestions to make the code more maintainable and aligned with industry best practices:

**Class Naming Convention**

The class name `TestTarget` seems to be a good choice, but it's not entirely clear what this class represents. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `DateTimeTestModel` or `TestModelWithDateProperties`.

**Property Naming Convention**

The property names `Nullable` and `NotNullable` follow the PascalCase convention, which is good. However, the names themselves could be more descriptive. Consider renaming them to something like `DateTimeOptional` and `DateTimeRequired`, respectively.

**Consider using a Base Class**

Since this class is a test model, it might be beneficial to create a base class for all test models. This base class could encapsulate common properties and behavior, making it easier to maintain and extend.

**Consider using a Contract-First Approach**

In the test model, the properties are simply getters and setters. Consider using a contract-first approach, where the properties are defined as interfaces and then implemented in the class. This approach can provide benefits such as:

* Better decoupling between different parts of the code
* Easier testing and mocking of dependencies
* Improved maintainability and scalability

Here's an updated version of the code incorporating these suggestions:
```csharp
using System;

namespace Eliassen.System.Tests.Linq.Expressions.TestModels
{
    public interface ITestModelWithDateProperties
    {
        DateTime? DateTimeOptional { get; set; }
        DateTime DateTimeRequired { get; set; }
    }

    public class DateTimeTestModel : ITestModelWithDateProperties
    {
        public DateTime? DateTimeOptional { get; set; }
        public DateTime DateTimeRequired { get; set; }
    }
}
```
By using an interface and a base class, the code becomes more flexible and maintainable. The interface defines the contract for the properties, and the base class provides a common implementation for the properties.

Of course, these are just suggestions, and the original code is already relatively simple and easy to understand. However, by applying these changes, the code becomes even more maintainable and scalable.
