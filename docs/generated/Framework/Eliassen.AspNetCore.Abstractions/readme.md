**Summary**
The Eliassen.AI.Abstractions library contains abstract definitions for ASP.Net Core Extensions. This library provides a set of classes and attributes that can be used to extend the functionality of ASP.Net Core applications. Specifically, it provides two main classes: `ApplicationRightAttribute` and `ApplicationRightRequirementFilter`. These classes are used to manage user rights and permissions in ASP.Net Core applications.

**Technical Summary**

The Eliassen.AI.Abstractions library uses a combination of design patterns and architectural patterns to implement its functionality. Specifically:

* The `ApplicationRightAttribute` class uses the **Interface Segregation Principle** (ISP) design pattern to define a contract for the required rights, allowing multiple clients to implement different sets of rights.
* The `ApplicationRightRequirementFilter` class uses the **Observer pattern** to notify the filter of changes to the user's rights, enabling the filter to react accordingly.
* The library uses a **Layered Architecture** pattern, with the abstractions namespace serving as a layer on top of the ASP.Net Core framework.

This diagram shows the relationships between the components in the Eliassen.AI.Abstractions library and the ASP.Net Core framework. The `ApplicationRightAttribute` and `ApplicationRightRequirementFilter` classes are part of the abstractions namespace, which communicates with the ASP.Net Core MVC framework and interacts with the authenticated user to manage rights and permissions.
