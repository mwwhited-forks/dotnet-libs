**README**

**Summary**

The Eliassen.System package provides a comprehensive set of classes and utilities for various system-related functionalities, including security, serialization, templating, and providers. This package is designed to be used with the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection framework to provide a wide range of features for building robust and scalable applications.

**Technical Summary**

The Eliassen.System package uses various design patterns and architectural patterns to achieve its functionality. These patterns include:

* **Service-Provider Pattern**: The package uses the Service-Provider pattern to register and resolve instances of various services, such as hash algorithms, serializers, and templating engines.
* **Builder Pattern**: The `SystemExtensionBuilder` class uses the Builder pattern to provide a fluent API for configuring system extensions.
* **singleton pattern**: The package uses the Singleton pattern to provide a centralized instance of various services, such as date time provider, guid provider, and temp file factory.

**Component Diagram**

Here is the component diagram for the Eliassen.System package using PlantUML:
