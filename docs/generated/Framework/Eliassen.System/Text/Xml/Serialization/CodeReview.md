Overall, the code appears to be written in a good manner, but there are a few suggestions I have to improve its maintainability:

**1. Rename Some Methods:** The method names do not immediately convey their purpose. Renaming them to something more descriptive would improve readability. For example, `Deserialize<T>` could be renamed to `DeserializeFromStream` or `DeserializeFromString`. Similarly, `Serialize<T>` could be renamed to `SerializeToObject` or `SerializeToString`.

**2. Extract Interface:** Since `DefaultXmlSerializer` implements `IXmlSerializer`, it would be beneficial to extract `IXmlSerializer` into an interface. This would make it easier to swap with other XML serialization implementations in the future.

**3. Clean Up Properties:** The `ContentType` property is not changed anywhere in the code. Consider removing it if it's not necessary.

**4. Avoid Using `System.Threading.Tasks` for Sync Methods:** When a method is marked as `virtual` and there are no overrides, it's generally a good idea to remove the `virtual` keyword. Also, if a method is not asynchronous, there's no need to return a `ValueTask`. This approach helps to clarify the intent and improves error reporting.

Here is a refactored version of the code based on the suggestions:

``` DefaultXmlSerializer.cs
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading;
using System.Xml;
using System.Xml.Serialization;

namespace Eliassen.System.Text.Xml.Serialization;

/// <summary).
public interface IXmlSerializer
{
    string Serialize(object obj, Type type);
    object? Deserialize(Stream stream, Type type);
    string Serialize<T>(T obj);
    T? Deserialize<T>(Stream stream);
}


public class DefaultXmlSerializer : IXmlSerializer
{
    public DefaultXmlSerializer()
    {
    }

    public string Serialize(object obj, Type type)
    {
        using var ms = new MemoryStream();
        using var writer = XmlWriter.Create(ms);
        var xml = new XmlSerializer(type);
        xml.Serialize(writer, obj);
        ms.Position = 0;
        using var reader = new StreamReader(ms);
        var read = reader.ReadToEnd();
        return read;
    }


    public object? Deserialize(Stream stream, Type type)
    {
        return new XmlSerializer(type).Deserialize(stream);
    }


    public string Serialize<T>(T obj)
    {
        if (obj == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(obj));
        using var ms = new MemoryStream();
        using var writer = XmlWriter.Create(ms);
        var xml = new XmlSerializer(obj.GetType());
        xml.Serialize(writer, obj);
        ms.Position = 0;
        using var reader = new StreamReader(ms);
        var read = reader.ReadToEnd();
        return read ;
    }


    public T? Deserialize<T>(Stream stream)
    {
        return (T?)new XmlSerializer(typeof(T)).Deserialize(stream);
    }
}

```
