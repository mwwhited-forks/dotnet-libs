As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll review the source code and provide suggestions for improving the coding patterns, methods, structure, and classes to make the code more maintainable.

**Initial Observations**

* The code is simple and straightforward, which is a good thing.
* However, it can be improved by following best practices and coding standards.
* The classes `DateTimeProvider` and `GuidProvider` are responsible for retrieving and generating date and time information, and GUIDs, respectively.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

**1. Simplify the classes**

* Both classes have only one or two properties each. Considering the simplicity of the code, it might be better to remove the classes and use static methods or utility classes instead.
* For example, the `DateTimeProvider` class can be replaced with static methods in a new class called `DateTimeUtilities`.

**2. Improve Naming Conventions**

* The property names `Now` and `UtcNow` in the `DateTimeProvider` class are not descriptive enough. Consider changing them to something like `GetCurrentDateTime` and `GetUtcDateTime`.
* The property name `Empty` in the `GuidProvider` class is also not descriptive. Consider changing it to something like `GetEmptyGuid`.

**3. Remove Redundant Comments**

* Some comments, such as the one in the `DateTimeProvider` class, are unnecessary. Try to remove them or make them more concise.

**4. Consider using const**

* The `Guid.Empty` property is a const value. Consider defining a const variable in the `GuidProvider` class instead.

**5. Refactor the `NewGuid` method**

* The `NewGuid` method is a good candidate for refactoring. Consider making it a private method and providing a public method that returns a new GUID, such as `GetNewGuid`.

**6. Implement Interface**

* The `DateTimeProvider` and `GuidProvider` classes implement interfaces `IDateTimeProvider` and `IGuidProvider`, respectively. Consider implementing methods that return specific date and time information, such as `GetCurrentDateTime` and `GetUtcDateTime`.

Here's an updated version of the code:

```csharp
// DateTimeUtilities.cs
using System;

namespace Eliassen.System.Providers
{
    public static class DateTimeUtilities
    {
        public static DateTime GetCurrentDateTime() => DateTime.Now;
        public static DateTime GetUtcDateTime() => DateTime.UtcNow;
    }
}

// GuidProvider.cs
using System;

namespace Eliassen.System.Providers
{
    public class GuidProvider : IGuidProvider
    {
        private const Guid EmptyGuid = Guid.Empty;

        public Guid GetEmptyGuid() => EmptyGuid;

        public Guid GetNewGuid() => Guid.NewGuid();
    }
}
```

These changes will make the code more maintainable, readable, and easier to understand.
