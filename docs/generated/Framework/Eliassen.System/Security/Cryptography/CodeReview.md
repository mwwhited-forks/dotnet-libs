As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll review the provided code and suggest improvements to make it more maintainable, scalable, and efficient.

**1. Class structure and naming:**

The `HashTypes` enum and the `Md5Hash`, `Sha256Hash`, and `Sha512Hash` classes can be organized under a single `HashAlgorithm` class or an interface (`IHashAlgorithm`) and a base class (`BaseHashAlgorithm`). This would allow for a more hierarchical and cohesive structure.

**2. Consistent naming convention:**

The naming convention used in the code is mostly consistent, but the `GetHash` method in the `Md5Hash`, `Sha256Hash`, and `Sha512Hash` classes can be renamed to `ComputeHash` or `Hash` to follow the standard convention for hash function methods.

**3. Generic hash algorithm implementation:**

Instead of implementing separate classes for each hash algorithm, you can create a generic base class (`BaseHashAlgorithm`) that takes a hash algorithm as a parameter. This would allow for a more flexible and scalable solution.

**4. Error handling and robustness:**

The code does not handle exceptions or edge cases. You should add exception handling and error checking to ensure that the code can handle unexpected inputs or algorithm failures.

**5. Unit tests:**

Although not explicitly shown, you should write unit tests to verify the correctness and robustness of the hash algorithm implementations. This would ensure that the code behaves as expected under various scenarios.

Here is the refactored code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Text;

namespace Eliassen.System.Security.Cryptography;

public enum HashTypes
{
    Md5,
    Sha256,
    Sha512
}

public interface IHashAlgorithm
{
    string Hash(string value);
}

public abstract class BaseHashAlgorithm : IHashAlgorithm
{
    protected readonly HashAlgorithm _hashAlgorithm;

    protected BaseHashAlgorithm(HashAlgorithm hashAlgorithm)
    {
        _hashAlgorithm = hashAlgorithm;
    }

    public virtual string Hash(string value)
    {
        var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(value);
        var hashBytes = _hashAlgorithm.ComputeHash(bytes);
        return Convert.ToBase64String(hashBytes);
    }
}

public class Md5Hash : BaseHashAlgorithm
{
    public Md5Hash()
        : base(new MD5CryptoServiceProvider())
    {
    }
}

public class Sha256Hash : BaseHashAlgorithm
{
    public Sha256Hash()
        : base(new SHA256CryptoServiceProvider())
    {
    }
}

public class Sha512Hash : BaseHashAlgorithm
{
    public Sha512Hash()
        : base(new SHA512CryptoServiceProvider())
    {
    }
}
```

**Improved code features:**

*   The code implements the `IHashAlgorithm` interface, providing a consistent way to compute hashes for different algorithms.
*   The `BaseHashAlgorithm` class encapsulates the hash computation, allowing for easier addition of new hash algorithms.
*   The hash algorithm implementations are decoupled from the specific algorithm classes, promoting maintainability and scalability.
*   Unit testing and error handling can be added to ensure the correctness and robustness of the hash algorithm implementations.
