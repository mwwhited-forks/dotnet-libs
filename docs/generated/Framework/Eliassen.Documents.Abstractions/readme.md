**README**

This project contains the necessary components for interacting with blob containers in a .NET 8.0 application. The project is designed to provide a flexible and scalable architecture for storing and retrieving binary data.

**Summary**

The project consists of several core components:

* `IBlobContainer`: An interface for interacting with blob containers. It provides methods for getting and storing content, metadata, and querying content metadata.
* `IContentTypeDetector`: An interface for detecting the content type of a stream.
* `IDocumentConversion`: An interface for converting documents from one format to another.

The project also includes an abstraction layer for blob container interaction, `Eliassen.Documents.Abstractions.csproj`, which provides a common interface for accessing blob containers.

**Technical Summary**

The project employs several design patterns and architectural patterns:

* Singleton pattern: The `IBlobContainer` interface is implemented as a singleton, allowing for a single instance of the blob container to be accessed throughout the application.
* Interface seggregation: The `IBlobContainer` interface is segregated into separate interfaces for different blob container operations, allowing for increased flexibility and modularity.
* Dependency injection: The project uses dependency injection to inject instances of `IBlobContainer` and other dependencies into components that require them.

This component diagram illustrates the relationships between the different components and dependencies within the project. The system is divided into two main components: `BlobContainer` and `DocumentConversion`, each containing interfaces and components that interact with each other. The `ContentTypeDetection` package provides an interface for detecting the content type of a stream, which is used by the `DocumentConversion` component. The `BlobContainer` component is implemented as a singleton and provides an interface for interacting with blob containers.
