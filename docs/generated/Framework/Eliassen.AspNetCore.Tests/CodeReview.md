As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I will review the provided code (Eliassen.AspNetCore.Tests.csproj) and suggest changes to make it more maintainable.

**Observations and Suggestions:**

1. **PropertyGroup:** The `<ImplicitUsings>` property is set to `false`, which is good practice for ensuring explicit imports.
2. **TargetFramework:** The project targets `net8.0`, which is compatible with the latest .NET Core releases.
3. **IsPackable and IsTestProject:** These properties are correctly set to `false` and `true`, respectively.

**Suggestions:**

1. **Class organization:** The csproj file seems to be containing multiple project references, which may lead to a problem of having too many projects referenced from this one. Consider breaking out the tests into separate test projects for each project being tested.
2. **PrivateAssets and IncludeAssets:** The `<coverlet.collector>` package reference includes a lot of assets that are not necessary for a test project. Consider narrowing down the assets to only what is necessary for the test project.
3. **Package references:** Some package references are included in this project (e.g., `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`, `MSTest.TestAdapter`, `MSTest.TestFramework`, etc.), which could lead to version conflicts. To avoid this, consider having separate package references for each project and ensure that they are of the same version.

**Changes:**

To make the code more maintainable, I suggest the following:

1. Create separate test projects for each project being tested.
2. Narrow down the `<coverlet.collector>` package reference to only what is necessary for the test project.
3. Consider having separate package references for each project and ensure that they are of the same version.

Here is an example of what the updated code might look like:

```XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>false</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="MSTest.TestAdapter" Version="3.4.3" />
    <PackageReference Include="MSTest.TestFramework" Version="3.4.3" />
    <PackageReference Include="coverlet.collector" Version="6.0.2">
      <PrivateAssets>runtime</PrivateAssets>
      <IncludeAssets>runtime</IncludeAssets>
    </PackageReference>
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

And for each project, create a separate test project:

```XML
<!-- Eliassen.AspNetCore.JwtAuthentication.Tests.csproj -->
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>false</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="MSTest.TestAdapter" Version="3.4.3" />
    <PackageReference Include="MSTest.TestFramework" Version="3.4.3" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

This improved organization would make the code more maintainable and easier to manage.
