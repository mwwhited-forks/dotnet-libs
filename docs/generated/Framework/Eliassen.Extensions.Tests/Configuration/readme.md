**README File**

This repository contains a set of unit tests for the `Eliassen.Extensions.Configuration` namespace, which provides extensions for the .NET Configuration system. The tests cover two specific sets of functionality: the `CommandLine` extension methods for building and adding parameters, and the `ConfigurationBuilderExtensions` methods for adding in-memory collections to the configuration builder.

**Technical Summary**

The `CommandLine` extension methods provide a way to build and add parameters to the configuration system from the command line. This is achieved through the use of a `TestHarness` class, which defines the properties to be added to the configuration. The `AddParameters` method adds the properties to a dictionary, which can then be used to populate the configuration.

The `ConfigurationBuilderExtensions` methods, on the other hand, provide a way to add in-memory collections to the configuration builder. This is done through the use of a `Dictionary<string, string>` or a `Tuple<string, string>` object, which is added to the configuration builder using the `AddInMemoryCollection` method.

**Design Patterns**

The design patterns used in this repository include:

* **Strategy Pattern**: The `CommandLine` extension methods use a strategy pattern to determine how to build and add the parameters to the configuration.
* **Builder Pattern**: The `TestHarness` class uses a builder pattern to construct the properties to be added to the configuration.
* **Composite Pattern**: The `ConfigurationBuilderExtensions` methods use a composite pattern to add multiple in-memory collections to the configuration builder.

**Component Diagram**

```plantuml
@startuml
component "Eliassen.Extensions.Configuration" {
  component "CommandLine" {
    method BuildParameters
    method AddParameters
  }
  component "ConfigurationBuilderExtensions" {
    method AddInMemoryCollection

  component "TestHarness" {

This diagram shows the components and their relationships. The `Eliassen.Extensions.Configuration` component contains the `CommandLine` and `ConfigurationBuilderExtensions` components, which are used to build and add parameters to the configuration system. The `TestHarness` component defines the properties to be added to the configuration.
